            </ul>
        <h2><b>For the Breading:</b></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup panko</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
        <h2><b>For the Tonkatsu:</b></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 boneless pork loin chops</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>3 cups neutral oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps to make:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>If you prefer not to deep-fry, see my recipe for Baked Tonkatsu.</li>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients. I highly recommend using fresh panko (called nama panko) from a Japanese grocery store, if available. If you can’t get it, follow my instructions below to make fresh panko using dried panko. Make sure to use a Japanese brand of panko from Japan. Western “panko breadcrumbs” are a bit different from authentic Japanese panko.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>To Prepare the Shredded Cabbage:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To prepare it, shred 1/4 head green cabbage very finely with a sharp knife or slicer. I love to use a cabbage slicer (you can get one from Amazon or JOC Goods) because it saves time and energy! I also thinly slice 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber diagonally, then cut them into thin strips. Toss the cabbage and cucumber together and set aside. Prepare 4 Tbsp Japanese sesame dressing (store bought or make homemade Japanese Sesame Dressing) and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>To make the Dipping Sauce:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Grind 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds and 1 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds. Leave some seeds unground for texture.</li>
                <li>Divide the ground sesame seeds among individual dipping plates or bowls. Then divide 4 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce (store bought or homemade) among them. Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>To Prepare the Fresh Panko and Breading:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place 1/2 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) in a deep dish and spray with water until the panko is moist (I use a mister). Set aside for 15 minutes, or until the panko becomes soft and tender.</li>
                <li>Crack 1 large egg into a deep dish or my favorite prep trays. Add 1/2 Tbsp neutral oil and whisk together until well combined. Then, prepare another dish or tray with all-purpose flour (plain flour).</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>To Prepare the Pork:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season both sides with 1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and 1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>To Bread the Pork:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, dredge the pork in the flour and dust off any excess. Next, dip the pork into the egg mixture and coat well.</li>
                <li>Dredge the pork in the fresh panko and gently press it to adhere to the cutlet. Gently shake off any excess, then place the breaded cutlets onto a tray or plate. Set them aside for 5–10 minutes to set the breading.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>To Fry:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add 3 cups neutral oil to a pot.</li>
                <li>Gently put one pork cutlet into the oil and let it cook for 1 minute. Don‘t flip it or touch it for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>After a minute, flip the pork and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Remove the pork and let the excess oil drip off by holding the cutlet vertically over the pot for a few seconds. Place it on a wire rack or paper towel and prop it on its side, if possible, to drain excess oil. Let it sit for 4 minutes. The residual heat will continue to cook the meat as it rests.</li>

            </ol>
        <h3>...and voila! A fried delectable with an audible crunch.</h3>
